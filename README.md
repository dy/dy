Software as a service to Krishna, see [krishnized license](https://github.com/krishnized/license).
Find inspiring and relevant use cases, analyze value, opportunities, perspectives, hidden gems. Point at obvious defects, omitments, confusions and redundancies.
For variable naming the best is abbreviated naming.
For phrases the best is tricolon or less.
