<!--
DRY: Don't repeat yourself.
SOC: Separate Concerns, one reason to change.
Make it work, make it right, make it fast. 
Best design is no design.
YAGNI: Don't build what you don't need yet
KISS: Complexity is debt
Fail first: surface errors early.
Convention over Configuration: sane defaults.
Principle of Least Astonishment: Predictable behavior
Perfection is not when nothing to add, but to remove.
Prefer elegant, sattvic, aesthetic, ergonomic, practical DX, UX, AX.
Code style is minimal, functional, clear and streamlined, concise, clever, eclectic.
Software as a service to Krishna, see [krishnized license](https://github.com/krishnized/license).
Find inspiring and relevant use cases, analyze value, opportunities, perspectives, hidden gems. Point at obvious defects, omitments, confusions and redundancies.
For variable naming the best is abbreviated naming.
